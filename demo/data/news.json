However, restrictions on female land ownership, limited access to credit and farm advisory services, and a lack of education hamper women&rsquo;s ability to produce and access more food and earn decent incomes.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAn FAO study estimates that closing the gender gap in access to productive resources such as land, credit, machinery or chemicals could eliminate yield gaps of 20% to 30% among women and men, increase domestic agricultural output by 2.5% to 4%, and mean up to 100 million fewer people living in hunger.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEven rural women working off-farm in low-skill jobs in agribusiness face gender discrimination and low wages. To address these problems, the report recommends that policymakers tackle laws and regulations which discriminate against women, particularly in land ownership, initiate programs to boost gender equality in agriculture and the labor market, while updating education and employment policies to be more gender sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFood security strategies must also be developed to improve women&rsquo;s access to childcare, farmer support mechanisms, and credit and agricultural services.

A few countries - Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan - have Social Protection Indexes that are higher than 0.200, meaning that they are already investing 8% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on social protection programs. However, spending in most middle-income countries, including Armenia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Samoa, remains below 3% of GDP.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe study notes that because social insurance tends to dominate government social protection spending, benefits accrue disproportionately to men and non-poor. Poor and disadvantaged persons, particularly those working in the informal sector, benefit less because they lack access to social insurance. They are instead targeted by social assistance programs that in many countries are fragmented and provide inadequate transfers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRelatively little is being spent on labor market programs like cash-for-work and skills development. This needs to be addressed amidst rising youth unemployment, critical skills gaps, and the disproportionate number of women who are unable to enter the formal labor market. Areas for government attention include employment guarantee schemes to construct or rebuild basic infrastructure, skills development, and technical and vocational education and training.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCountries at various stages of development need to set their own targets, taking into account available public resources. However, governments need to accelerate the review and reform of pension schemes in view of the region&rsquo;s huge informal sector and rapid aging. Preventive social protection programs such as micro-insurance schemes to cushion the impact of variable weather patterns and natural disasters should also be explored, the study says.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tExpanding social protection coverage requires mobilization of additional public revenue which can be secured by broadening the tax base, improving tax collection, and improving public expenditure management. Governments should also encourage private firms to contribute more to social insurance programs. After many years of high growth, the Asia and Pacific region is in an excellent position to invest in better social protection systems that are attuned to the needs of its people.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe new Social Protection Index was prepared by ADB and development partners; the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the OECD Korea Policy Center; and the International Labour Organization. It provides detailed information on the extent of social protection public expenditure, population coverage, as well as the impact on specific groups, including the poor and women.

Its Annual Evaluation Review 2013 highlights the growing risks and vulnerabilities that endanger the region&acirc;&#128;&#159;s hard-won socio-economic gains and success in reducing poverty.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Asia leads the world in the pace of growth, but governments need to be more conscious of the risks facing the region from economic, social, and environmental factors,&rdquo; says Independent Evaluation director general Vinod Thomas.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Emerging vulnerabilities point to a longer road than previously expected in eradicating extreme poverty in the region unless action is stepped up,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTackling them will require greater effort by governments and development agencies to provide effective early warnings of impending economic and financial shocks and adequate social safety nets in a region with among the world&acirc;&#128;&#159;s lowest levels of public expenditure on social protection. The other main source of vulnerability is from a marked increase in floods, storms, and drought worldwide, but especially in Asia and the Pacific. This will require governments to ramp up disaster preparedness.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;A big worry is that the uncertain outlook seems to be sapping the commitment of governments to finding novel solutions,&rdquo; says the report&acirc;&#128;&#159;s main author Walter Kolkma, director, Independent Evaluation. &ldquo;But the vulnerabilities need to be confronted because they will deflate economic growth while hitting the poor hardest.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAgainst this backdrop, evaluative evidence supports the effectiveness of governments transferring resources in cash directly to the poor to broaden their access to economic opportunities. Social safety nets have been shown to be effective in reducing poverty when cash transfers are conditioned on the poor sending their children to school and using health services.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA case in point is the Philippine government&acirc;&#128;&#159;s Pantawid Pamilya cash transfer program to the poor, which is conditional on beneficiary households meeting health and education targets. The ambitious program is showing promising early results, reaching nearly 4.0 million households by March 2013 and targeting 5.2 million by 2015.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMicrofinance programs also offer the potential for reducing poverty and promoting inclusive growth, but more so if linked to wider banking services than to credit alone, and if they are combined with social protection. But the access of financial services to the poor remains a struggle, as evaluative evidence has borne out time and again. A survey of six countries in the region showed that fewer than 9% of microfinance borrowers lived on below $1.25 a day and fewer than 22% on $2 a day.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the area of natural disasters, greater preparedness and better prevention works, such as river dikes and storm drains are another solution that needs to be scaled up. Despite crippling floods hitting Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, and Manila in recent years, disaster preparedness in most of Asia's developing countries remains disturbingly low. Many of the poor, living in unplanned, low-lying areas in cities, are at highest risk. Thomas says that systematic disaster risk reduction measures still do not feature sufficiently in national development plans, even in some countries where disasters strike with regularity.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are increasingly hit by extreme floods and storms described as &bdquo;once in a century.&acirc;&#128;&#159; Imagine three of them with the rainfall intensity of, say, tropical cyclone Ketsana hitting an area in a single year&mdash;it&acirc;&#128;&#159;s no longer that far-fetched,&rdquo; says Thomas, referring to the flooding that submerged large parts of Manila in 2009. &ldquo;As with stress tests against financial calamities, it&acirc;&#128;&#159;s high time we did stress tests against natural hazards.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCatastrophic floods and landslides in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand&mdash;which may have claimed over 1,000 lives&mdash;are an ominous start to the monsoon season. In Manila, the first rains of the season brought parts of the city to a standstill. The rains were not that heavy this time, but they exposed the city&acirc;&#128;&#159;s poor flood defenses all the same.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWith the heightened exposure to economic and environmental risks, Kolkma says that ensuring development projects are disaster resilient and bring sustainable benefits to the poor will be increasingly necessary. &ldquo;But sustainability&mdash;the continuity of project outcomes&mdash;is one of the least successful areas of development interventions,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe reasons vary among sectors and countries. But in infrastructure projects&mdash;an area in which development banks are highly active&mdash;budget constraints and the perception that climate proofing is expensive and a luxury, are often the main causes for lack of sustainability, next to a sometimes limited implementation capacity.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Putting more emphasis on sustainability when development projects are designed and completed is going to be an increasingly important facet of development work,&rdquo; says Kolkma.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t# # #<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo download the evaluation study, visit: http:\/\/www.adb.org\/documents\/2013-annual-evaluation-review and click on the PDF.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>About Independent Evaluation at the Asian Development Bank<\/strong>\n\tAsian Development Bank's Independent Evaluation, reporting to the Board of Directors through the Development Effectiveness Committee, contributes to development effectiveness by providing feedback on ADB's policies, strategies, operations, and special concerns in Asia and the Pacific.<\/p>\n","url":"http:\/\/www.adb.org\/news\/financial-uncertainty-destructive-start-monsoon-highlight-asias-growing-vulnerability","pubDate":"1 Jul 2013"}}]}
